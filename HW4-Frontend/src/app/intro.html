    In 2008, the National Cutting Horse Association passed a rule allowing clones to compete. 
    Champion cutting horse Smart Little Lena was cloned five times in 2006 by Texas A&M University, 
    according to the AQHA article. Offspring sired by any of the five would currently not be eligible 
    for registration with the AQHA, but would be able to compete in NCHA events.
